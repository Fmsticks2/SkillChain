# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Issue

Users were unable to complete the signup process after deployment due to missing NextAuth.js configuration.

## Root Cause

The application was missing the required `SessionProvider` from NextAuth.js, which is necessary for authentication to work properly, especially in deployed environments. Without this provider, the authentication state couldn't be properly maintained across the application.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added AuthProvider Component**
   - Created a new component at `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` that wraps the application with NextAuth's `SessionProvider`
   - This provider is essential for NextAuth to manage authentication state across the application

2. **Updated Root Layout**
   - Modified `app/layout.tsx` to include the `AuthProvider` as a wrapper around the entire application
   - This ensures all components have access to the authentication context

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added `.env.production` template with deployment-specific settings
   - Added comments to clarify the purpose of `NEXTAUTH_URL` for different environments
   - Created a detailed deployment guide for NextAuth configuration

## How to Test

1. Run the application locally with `npm run dev`
2. Try the signup process with different methods (email, OAuth providers)
3. Verify that you can complete the signup process and are redirected to the onboarding page
4. Check that your authentication state persists when navigating between pages

## Deployment Instructions

When deploying to production:

1. Set the correct `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to your actual deployed domain
2. Configure OAuth provider callback URLs in their respective developer consoles
3. Ensure all required environment variables are properly set in your deployment platform
